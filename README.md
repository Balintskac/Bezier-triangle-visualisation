# Geometry Framework

A reorganized (and hopefully better) version of my
[sample framework](https://github.com/salvipeter/sample-framework).

Added features:

- More extensible interface

- Handling multiple objects

- Better toolchain (CMake integration, Qt 6, OpenMesh 8)

Features to be (re)implemented:

- Normals / curvatures by jet fitting

Removed features:

- Mesh fairing

- Face-based curvature approximation

- Saving BÃ©zier surfaces
